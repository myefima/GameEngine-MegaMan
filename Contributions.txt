The following classes and files were initially provided by the instructor as a part
of the course. Classes which were modified by students in the course as future assignments, or implemented individually by students before making the game engine, are noted. Any code involving the use of classes not listed here was created by myself as a part of individual study coursework in Spring 2016.
